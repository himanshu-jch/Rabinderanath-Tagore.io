     <title>Tagore's Thought</title>
 </head>
 <body>
 <div class="bodysi" style="margin-top: -100px;">
     <p style="margin-bottom: 50px" >Tagore, a celebrated poet, philosopher, and Nobel laureate from India, had numerous profound thoughts and quotes. One of his most famous thoughts is.</p>
     <p style="margin-bottom: 50px" >"Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high,
     Where knowledge is free,
     Where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls,
     Where words come out from the depth of truth,
     Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection,
     Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit,
     Where the mind is led forward by thee into ever-widening thought and actionâ€”
     Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake."</p>
     <p style="margin-bottom: 50px" >This excerpt is taken from his famous poem "Where the Mind is Without Fear," which reflects his vision of an ideal and free society where individuals are unshackled by fear, ignorance, and narrow-mindedness. Tagore's works often explored themes of freedom, humanism, nature, and the interconnectedness of all living beings. He was an influential figure during the Indian independence movement and remains an inspiration to people around the world for his poetic and philosophical contributions.</p>
